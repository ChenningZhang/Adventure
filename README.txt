Adventure
=========
Write an adventure game. We'll provide most of the program. You will mostly make modification and some additions.

This project is designed to be done by two people working in parallel, then combining your results into one finished product. (Hereafter the two partners are called Person A and Person B.) But you will combine your work to hand in a single report for your group.

The project begins with two exercises that everyone should do; these exercises do not require new programming, but rather familiarize you with the overall structure of the program as we've provided it. After that, each person has separate exercises. There is one final exercise for everyone that requires the two partners' work to be combined. (Therefore, you should probably keep notes about all of the procedures that you've modified during the project, so you can notice the ones that both partners modified independently.)

This is a two-week project. Once you finish all of the exercises for the entire project, your group should make one submission (not one per person) including your modified adv.scm program with the modifications highlighted, and a transcript of the testing of your work. Indicate somewhere in your submission which of you is person A and which is person B. Make this is very prominent and easy to find!
